# SOTN-CommunityHackingTable
This is a list of SymphonyOfTheNight ISO addresses that can be edited for game modding purposes, and then written to the ISO.

It uses Cheat Engine (cheat engine can apparently write to ISOs), 
because that makes it easier to share between hackers
and build a nice list over time to make the game better.

SOTN modding is slow, and we should work together to make things happen.
